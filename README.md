This notebook allows you to view various analytics of over 16,000 video game sales between 2000-2016. There are visualizations of the data as well as a prediction model
that can be used to estimate how much money a game could make.
Included is the document "GameSalesDocument.docx." It contains a project proposal for executives, a project proposal for the IT department, as well as a post-implementation report.
The business problem this project seeks to solve is the lack of success in recently developed games by a made-up company.
